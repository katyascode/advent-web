## About the project: Katya's Holiday Countdown

In the 2024 holiday season, I wanted to get creative with the way I gift. So, I made a digital advent calendar for my friends! Built on React, Next.js for routing and optimization, Firebase to create a quick and secure backend, styled with Tailwind and deployed on Verce. I designed and built this web app over a few weeks. Check out the video demo below.
